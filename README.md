# Nsp's chess pieces

Here I drawed various chess iconsets, standard and 5D-specific pieces.

## List of Pieces

Shown is an example of iconset file.

The pieces and their corresponding notations are:

#### Standard (top)

- Pawn (P)
- Knight (N)
- Bishop (B)
- Rook (R)
- Queen (Q)
- King (K)

#### 5D-specific (bottom)

- Brawn (W; pawn with more 'diagonal' moves)
- Unicorn (U; moves 'triagonally')
- Dragon (D; moves 'quadragonally')
- Princess (S; bishop + rook, but not unicorn and dragon)
- Royal queen (Y)
- Common king (C; a non-royal piece with king's movability)

## Files & Usage

- `pieces.png` includes `PNBRQK/WUDSYC` in a format used by 5D Chess client.
- To use in 5D Chess, locate the game's local file folder (In Steam, Settings button for the game > `Manage` > `Browse Local Files`),
  rename the original `pieces.png` to something else and put the file into the folder.
  You should not change the file's name, dimension and color mode.
