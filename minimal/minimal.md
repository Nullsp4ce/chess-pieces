# Minimal theme

Minimalistic, inspired by 'Shapes' set in lichess

## Design

The pieces face their move direction with their edges, instead of points.
Coupled with more solid insides, this builds smooth motion when animated (IMO). Mainly affects R/B/princess.

Rook + bishop produces a 2D queen (a princess), and 5D queen is modified from it to reflect the possibilities.

Knight, unicorn and dragon has different tails, and unicorn/dragon's tail matches the amount of dimensions they use at once.

Or does the dragon look like a dragon?
